## Lab 7 - Tables and Constructors

### What this is:
* We learned about creating object literals and appending them to the DOM in an unordered list with our previous lab, the Fruit Stand. Now, we're using class constructors to make objects in a much cleaner way.
* Then, we take those objects and append them to the DOM, but instead of appending them into a list, we're now appending them into tables.

### Technical info:
* I have a class constructor in fruit.js that defines what should go into each object instance.
* I then define a number of new Fruit objects in app.js, and then iterate through them using a for loop and append them into the table in the index.html.
